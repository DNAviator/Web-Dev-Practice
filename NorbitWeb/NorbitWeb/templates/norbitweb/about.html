          <h2>Norbit Engineering: Where Youthful Ingenuity Meets Inventive Solutions</h2>
          <br>
          We're not your average engineering firm. We're a team of four passionate high schoolers - Ryan (worksite
          manager),
          Caleb (chief engineering officer), Molly (head of the art department), and Joseph (CEO) - who believe that
          age
          is
          just a number when it comes to innovation. We're driven by a shared passion for problem-solving and a desire
          to make
          a difference, and our youthful energy translates into dynamic brainstorming sessions and a fearless approach
          to
          tackling challenges.
          <br><br>
          <h2>From Lockpicking to Lunar Rovers: A Glimpse into Our Past Projects</h2>
          <br>
          Our journey began with a seemingly simple request - a custom lock that defied conventional design. Utilizing
          our
          diverse skillsets, we combined intricate mechanics with artistic flair, creating a unique and secure
          solution.
          This
          initial project sparked a fire within us, and soon, we were tackling increasingly complex challenges.
          <br><br>
          Next, we set our sights on harnessing the power of gravity. Our gravity-driven vehicle, fueled by ingenuity
          and
          meticulous calculations, defied expectations and proved that even the most basic principles can yield
          impressive
          results. This project not only pushed our engineering expertise but also highlighted our ability to think
          outside
          the box.
          <br><br>
          But our ambitions didn't stop there. We craved a project that truly tested our mettle - and the distance
          measuring
          car was born. This intricate machine, equipped with advanced mechanical mechanisms, accurately
          measured
          distances, showcasing our dedication to precision and innovation.
          <br><br>
          These are just a few examples of what we've accomplished. Each project has been a learning experience,
          pushing
          us to
          grow, collaborate, and refine our skills. We believe in learning by doing, and our projects are our
          classrooms,
          where we hone our talent and turn dreams into reality.</p>
